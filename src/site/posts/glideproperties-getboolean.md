`gs.getProperty()` returns the property value as string irrespective of the type of property being accessed. But, if you are in global scope and want to return a property as 'Boolean', you can use `GlideProperties.getBoolean()` instead. Additionally, there is also a function `GlideProperties.getInt()` to return the property value as 'int'.
